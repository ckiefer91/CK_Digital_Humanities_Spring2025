<blockquote cite ="https://www.hevercastle.co.uk/news/19th-may-anniversary-of-anne-boleyns-execution"> <p>  Good Christian people, I have not come here to preach a sermon; I have come here to die. For according to the law and by the law I am judged to die, and therefore I will speak nothing against it. I am come hither to accuse no man, nor to speak of that whereof I am accused and condemned to die, but I pray God save the King and send him long to reign over you, for a gentler nor a more merciful prince was there never, and to me he was ever a good, a gentle, and sovereign lord. And if any person will meddle of my cause, I require them to judge the best. And thus I take my leave of the world and of you all, and I heartily desire you all to pray for me.</p> </blockquote>
<p> Anne Boleyn may not be my favorite person in history, but I credit Tudor history for cultivating a love of historical thinking in me as a teenager. She was a fascinating person, and I wanted to know why she made the choices she did. More than that, I wanted to know the social culture of the world she lived in that fostered men's response to her behavior. Why would she be accused of being a witch? Of committing incest? Did she love Henry? Was she politically ambitious? Was she really a tool of her family, or did people not give her credit for her own ideas as she was a woman?</p> 
<p> Anne Boleyn was the second life of the infamous King Henry VIII in England. She held a part in Henry creating the Church of England, as he did so to grant himself the ability to divorce his first wife. Some of the sources that survive are love letters between the two, especially Henry to Anne. These prove that he sought after Anne for years, but that she resisted being just a mistress. She wanted to be a wife, and a Queen. Anne and Henry had one living children, Elizabeth, who was eventually Queen Elizabeth I of England.</p>
